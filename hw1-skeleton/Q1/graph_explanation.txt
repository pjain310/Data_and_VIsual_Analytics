Coloured the nodes according to modularity class to identify custers/sub-genres (movies within drama category which are similar).OpenOrd to try and cluster nodes accordind to the modularity class,Force Atlas 2 to reduce edge overlap. Adjusted size according to harmonic clustering coeff and filtered out nodes with degree < 2. I added labels for each of the sub-clusters I identified.
